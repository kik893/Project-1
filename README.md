**How the Data was Scraped**
  
I queried the GitHub API for users in Delhi with more than 100 followers. Then, I collected information on up to 500 of their most recent public repositories. The data was saved in two CSV files: users.csv and repositories.csv.

**Most Interesting Fact**

Many popular repositories, despite having high star counts, lack wikis and project management features. Improving documentation could greatly benefit these projects.

**Recommendation for Developers**

Developers should use wikis and project boards more effectively to enhance project documentation and teamwork.
